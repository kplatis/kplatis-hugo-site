I am a Full Stack Developer working at the Blue Brain Project of EPFL. I also hold a Master of Science in Computer 
Science from Georgia Institute of Technology specializing in Machine Learning. In the past, I have worked as a Full 
Stack Developer at CERN, right after receiving my Bachelor's Degree from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

My current goal is to contribute while expanding my knowledge in the field of computer science and full stack development.
